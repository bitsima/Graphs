Algorithms lab programming assignment 3, 01.05.2023
Graphs - Connected Components, Digraph Traversal and Cycle Detection, Minimum Spanning Trees

In this we've lent a helping hand to our hero Samurai Jack, exploring the possibilities of graphs. The assignment consisted of three parts:
1- Finding the least dangerous path connecting all the cities for our hero - basically finding the minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph.
2 - Finding all the different colonies we need to send our beetle drones to - finding all different connected components on a directed graph.
3 - Locating the time traps evil lord Aku has placed in the colonies, so our hero can evade them easily - locating cycles and the nodes comprising them on a directed graph.
